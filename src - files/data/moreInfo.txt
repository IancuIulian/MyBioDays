    "Biorhythmia is the science that studies the biological
rhythms of the human body, acting and reacting in a
cyclical way. Biological cycles are divided into three
broad categories, each of them having a duration that is
it's own."  -  Hans Crawley

    Quoted from the book:
"Les horloges internes de la vie -
    La biorithmie a la portee de tous"   by Hans Crawley.

    biorhythmia is at hand for everyone")
