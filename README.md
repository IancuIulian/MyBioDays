# MyBioDays
  Inspired by Hans Crawley's book "The Internal Clocks of Life", this little program offers information about the Physical, Emotional
and Intelectual cicles of a given date. The author believes that we can calculate our cicle days and determine how we are going to feel. 
He also gives solutions about how we ought to behave during these days. Indeed, a powerful tool.
